\figUsecase

Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) is a special type of encryption scheme that
enables computing on encrypted data directly, without decrypting it. FHE allows
a client to offload a computation to an untrusted server without revealing any
data~\cite{chen:ccs17:privset-fhe,DBLP:conf/tcc/GentryH19,gilad:icml16:cryptonets}.

Unfortunately, FHE is computationally very expensive: up to 100,000x slower
than the same computation on unencrypted data~\cite{halevi:crypto14:algorithms-helib}.
Prior work identified that the key computational kernel in FHE is the so-called
ChangeRnsBase algorithm, accounting for $\sim$90\% of the
compute\cite{samardzic:isca22:craterlake}.
The goal of this project will be to see how fast ChangeRnsBase can run in
software on an AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 3975WX.

Existing software libraries implement less-performant FHE schemes that do not
have the ChangeRnsBase bottleneck.
While these libraries avoid the
ChangeRnsBase, the total amount of both data movement and compute is actually
higher than when the ChangeRnsBase is used\cite{samardzic:isca22:craterlake}.
Further, the ChangeRnsBase is amenable to parallelism as it has a
computationally meaty kernel inside a trivially parallelizable loop.
When the ChangeRnsBase is avoided, the opportunities for parallelism are less
obvious.
