\tblMain
\tblMainNew

\autoref{tbl:main} and \autoref{tbl:mainNew} show the performance of RNS base
change before and after our improvements as a function of polynomial degree
($N$), the number of input residues ($R_{\textrm{src}}$) and output residues
($R_{\textrm{dst}}$).

We see that performance is roughly proportional to $N R_{\textrm{src}}
R_{\textrm{dst}}$ across systems and both for the old and new implementations.
We also see robust speedups, i.e., 2.3--2.5$\times$, over the old implementation.
This speedup comes exclusively from the SIMD instructions we use in RNS base
change, because we made no other improvements.
