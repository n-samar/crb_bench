\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

%Recent FHE accelerators have made great progress towards making FHE practical,
%but these accelerators focus on FHE schemes designed for CPUs.
Making full use of FHE accelerators requires redesigning FHE algorithms to use them well.
We have presented \name, a new implementation of the state-of-the-art CKKS scheme that addresses
the overheads of the standard RNS-CKKS implementation.
\name decouples CKKS scales from residue sizes, enabling high utilization of accelerator datapaths.
This significantly improves performance, efficiency, and area, with no precision loss or other downsides.

In evaluating \name, we have also explored the impact of hardware word size on accelerator design,
a previously overlooked dimension where existing accelerators took widely different choices.
We have shown that, with RNS-CKKS, accelerators suffer from uneven performance and efficiency at \emph{any} word size,
due to the wide range of scales needed by applications. \name avoids this problem,
and makes narrow (28-bit) words the most efficient choice.
