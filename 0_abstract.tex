Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a revolutionary cryptographic technique
that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without the need for
decryption. FHE holds immense potential for preserving privacy and
confidentiality in various domains, such as cloud computing, data sharing, and
machine learning. However, one of the major challenges in practical adoption of
FHE is its high computational overhead, particularly on central processing
units (CPUs).

To that end, we improve the performance of \verb!dumb_ckks!, the
state-of-the-art Rust FHE library, by gmean 2.41$\times$ by changing the data
layout of FHE polynomials---
the fundamental type in FHE computation---to be more amenable to SIMD vectorization.
