\vspace{-0.15in} % dsm: Fix weird spacing issue

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables computing directly on encrypted
data.
Though FHE is slow on a CPU, recent hardware accelerators compensate most of
FHE's overheads, enabling real-time performance in complex programs like deep
neural networks.
However, the state-of-the-art FHE scheme, CKKS, is inefficient on accelerators.
CKKS represents encrypted data using
integers of widely different sizes (typically 30 to 60 bits).
This leaves many bits unused in registers and arithmetic datapaths.
This overhead is minor in CPUs, but accelerators are dominated by
multiplications, so poor utilization causes large area and energy
overheads.

We present \name, a new implementation of CKKS that keeps encrypted data packed
in fixed-size words, enabling near-full arithmetic efficiency in
accelerators.
\name is the first redesign of an FHE scheme that targets accelerators.
On a state-of-the-art accelerator,
\name improves performance by gmean \OK{53\%} and by up to \OK{3\x},
and reduces energy by gmean \OK{66\%}.
\name does not reduce precision and can be applied to all prior accelerators without hardware changes.
